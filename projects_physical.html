    <h1>Physical-Layer Network Coding</h1>
    
    <p>
    We first consider the  noisy channel for fixed fading conditions.

    <p>
    We first consider the Two-Way Relay Channel (TWRC) as a foundation for the more involved multi-way relaying situation.
    We have two users, each able to send 4 distinct signals. One possible realisation of this is Quadrature Phase Shift Keying.
    We intentionally let the users communicate at the same time, allowing interference. The relay receives a signal of the following form:
    $$H_{1}x_{1} + H_{2}x_{2} + n_{R}$$
    </p>

    <!--
    TODO:
        - user constellations
        - what is a constellations
        - show where the combinations arise
        - explain H coefficients 
        - show formula being used in matlab for constellation
        - primer on signal space analysis
    -->

    <p>
    If we now allow each user to send $8$ distinct signals the relay can receive a total of $8^{2}$ or $64$ possible values. This can also be visualised 
    by varying the fading coefficients for each of the two channels.
