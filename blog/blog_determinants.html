        The \( \hat{\textbf{i}} \) and \( \hat{\textbf{j}} \) unit vectors are mapped to new locations. Where they land make up the columns
        of the matrix describing that movement. Seeing as \( \hat{\textbf{i}} \) and \( \hat{\textbf{j}} \) form a basis, they span the space
        and are orthogonal to each other, we can express all vectors in this space as a linear combination of just these 2 vectors.

        \[ \hat{\textbf{i}}  = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0\end{pmatrix}, \hat{\textbf{j}} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1\end{pmatrix} \]
        </p>

        <p>
        The matrix that moves these unit vectors to their new locations has columns that are the final x and y coordinates of where they
        land.

        \[A = \begin{pmatrix} x_1 & x_2 \\ y_1 & y_2 \end{pmatrix}\]
        </p>

        <p>
        The determinant is a measure of how the area of each box on the grid changes after we move \( \hat{\textbf{i}} \) and \( \hat{\textbf{j}} \)
        to their new locations. So in the original case where we start with our unit vectors the area of a grid box can be found by multiplying the 
        width and height, which here is \(1 \cdot 1 = 1\).
        </p>

        <p>
        So now let's map our unit vectors to their new locations! We multiply each unit vector by the matrix \(A\), remembering that each column
        of \(A\) will be where our \( \hat{\textbf{i}} \) and \( \hat{\textbf{j}} \) unit vectors will land respectively.

        \[A\hat{\textbf{i}} = \begin{pmatrix} x_1 & x_2 \\ y_1 & y_2 \end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} = 
        1\begin{pmatrix}x_1 \\ y_1\end{pmatrix} + 0\begin{pmatrix}x_2 \\ y_2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}x_1 \\ y_1 \end{pmatrix}\]

        \[A\hat{\textbf{j}} = \begin{pmatrix} x_1 & x_2 \\ y_1 & y_2 \end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = 
        0\begin{pmatrix}x_1 \\ y_1\end{pmatrix} + 1\begin{pmatrix}x_2 \\ y_2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}x_2 \\ y_2 \end{pmatrix}\]
        </p>

        <p>
        We have our unit vectors mapped to their new locations! So how has the area of the grid changed...? We can find out by considering 
        the following setup. In general the area of the grid can be found as the area of a parallelogram (the area is also signed in that it
        can be negative, we'll come back to this later). The new setup is pictured below. 

        <div class="flex-center">
            <figure>

                <figcaption>Our Mapped Unit Vectors</figcaption>
            </figure>
        </div>
        </p>


        <p>
        Let's really hammer home what's going on before we go any further. We have done three things here:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>We have stretched the length of each of the unit vectors.</li>
            <li>We have rotated the entire plane, keeping all lines parallel and equally spaced.</li>
            <li>We did the rotation around the origin so the origin does not move!</li>
        </ul>
        <p>    
        The grid before and after this transformation is shown here:
        <div class="flex-center">
            <figure>
                <img  src="/Sources/DeterminantArea/angleBetweenVectors_grids.png" width="100%">
                <figcaption>Mapping from original grid</figcaption>
            </figure>
        </div>
        </p>

        <p>
        Now all we need to find out is how the area of the grid elements has changed. So what we're really saying is 
        that we want to find the area of the parallelogram given some arbitrary mapping \(A\). Finding the area of a parallelogram
        is easy once we see it's a rectangle in disguise...
        <div class="flex-center">
            <figure>

                <figcaption>Area of parallelogram and equivalent rectangle</figcaption>
            </figure>
        </div>
        </p>

        <p>
        Given this, we need to find the bottom side length and the length of the dashed perpendicular line. The bottom is the distance from
        the origin to the tip of the \(A\hat{\textbf{i}}\) vector, which is \(\sqrt{x_1^2 + y_1^2}\). The dashed perpendicular line is 
        \(\sqrt{x_2^2 + y_2^2}\cos{\phi}\)
        </p>

        <p>
        We'll also need to find the angle \(\theta\), we'll use the dot product to figure this out. For any two vectors \(\vec{v}\) and \(\vec{w}\)
        we can compute the dot product by taking the sum of the product of their components or using the following:

        \[ \vec{v} \cdot \vec{w}  = |\vec{v}||\vec{w}|\cos{\theta}\]

        where \(|\vec{v}|\), \(|\vec{w}|\) are the vectors' respective magnitudes (distance from the origin). Let's call the perpendicular distance
        \(p\). We said earlier that it's \(|A\hat{\textbf{j}}|\cos{\phi}\). Can we relate \(\phi\) and \(\theta\)? Looking closely, we can see 
        that \(\phi\) is the extension past \(90^\circ\) or \(\frac{\pi}{2} \text{rad}\), so
        <sup data-comment="should be next to should be next to should be next to should be next to [1]" id ="ref1">[1]</sup>:
        \[\theta = \frac{\pi}{2} + \phi \text{ or } \phi = \theta - \frac{\pi}{2}\]

        Now it's possible to relate \(p\) to \(\theta\) like so:
        \[p = |A\hat{\textbf{j}}|\cos{\phi} = |A\hat{\textbf{j}}|\cos{\left(\theta - \frac{\pi}{2}\right)} = |A\hat{\textbf{j}}|\sin{\theta}\]
        </p>

        <p> 
        Ok, so where were we, the area of a parallelogram, which is secretly a rectangle. We can write that area now using what we've just found out:

        \[ \begin{aligned}
        \text{Area} &= p|A\hat{\textbf{i}}| \\
                    &= |A\hat{\textbf{i}}||A\hat{\textbf{j}}|\sin{\theta}\\
                    &= \sqrt{x_1^2 + y_1^2}\sqrt{x_2^2 + y_2^2}\sin{\left(\arccos\left[\frac{x_1 x_2 + y_1 y_2}{\sqrt{x_1^2 + y_1^2}\sqrt{x_2^2 + y_2^2}}\right]\right)}
        \end{aligned}
        \]

        Well that looks pretty horrible! However, we can make a few observations that will make this collapse down a lot...
        </p>

        The ratio of the dot product over the product of the magnitudes is constrained between -1 and 1 as it's equal to cos(theta). something
