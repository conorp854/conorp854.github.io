      <h1>Physical-Layer Network Coding [WIP]</h1>
    
      <p>
      Physical-Layer Network Coding (PNC) revolves around the concept of deliberate interference. A group of users communicate via a relay,
      in the same time slot. This results in the received signal at the relay being a superposition of all signals sent by the users in that 
      time slot. The two user case has been considered in extensive detail in literature, referred to as the Two Way Relay Channel (TWRC). 
      Here we consider the TWRC and consider the most promising techniques in the multi-way relaying case where we have more than two users.
      Throughout we consider perfect synchronisation between user nodes. All other concepts will be introduced as required in the form of 
      diagrams and animations, with mathematical formulations being provided for further detail.

    Signal Space Analysis. Allows the underlying waveforms to be abstracted away. Permit a vector representation of the signals.

      These are some possible signal sets that each user node can use when transmitting. The number of distinct
      symbols dictates the number of bits that a symbol can represent. Therefore we choose our number of symbols to
      be powers of 2. PSK is an initialism for Phase Shift Keying which is one possible modulation scheme. 
      We obtain the next point by maintaining the same distance from the origin and by increasing the phase.

      <p>
      In the presence of Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) our decision rule for incoming symbols becomes a maximum likelihood estimation, where 
      we assume that each symbol from the sender's alphabet has the same a priori probability. This rule is therefore, "Assign \(\hat{m} = m_k\) if my received signal
      is closer to \(s_k\) than to any other signal vector". This boils down to choosing which constellation point am I closest to.

      Consider the noisy channel for fixed fading conditions. Noise manifests itself as a perturbation to the constellation points. As the
    signal to noise ratio (SNR) becomes larger there is less perturbation to the incoming symbols.

      We have two users, each able to send 4 distinct signals. One possible realisation of this is Quadrature Phase Shift Keying.
      We intentionally let the users communicate at the same time, allowing interference. The relay receives a signal of the following form:
      \[H_{1}x_{1} + H_{2}x_{2} + n_{R}\]
    The coefficients \(H_1\) and \(H_2\) determine how much the constellation is rotated and contracted. Here we let the values vary and show the
    resulting constellation.

      If we allow each user to send \(8\) distinct signals the relay can receive a total of \(8^{2}\) or \(64\) possible values. This can also be visualised 
      by varying the fading coefficients for each of the two channels.
