            <h1>Quantum Gate Model and the Controlled-NOT</h1>

            <h2>What is the Controlled-NOT Gate?</h2>
            <p>
            The Controlled-NOT gate operates over two qubits, where one is designated the <b>control</b> and the other the <b>target</b>.
            If we consider the computational basis state to begin with, when the control qubit is in the state \(\ket{1}\), the 
            target qubit will be flipped. Otherwise, the target qubit will remain unchanged. So in the 2 qubit case we can summarise the rule as follows:

            \[\ket{T}\ket{C} \xrightarrow{CNOT} \ket{T \otimes C}\ket{C}\]

            This can be written out explicity in the case of 2 qubits:
            \[\ket{00} \xrightarrow{CNOT} \ket{00}\]
            \[\ket{01} \xrightarrow{CNOT} \ket{11}\]
            \[\ket{10} \xrightarrow{CNOT} \ket{10}\]
            \[\ket{11} \xrightarrow{CNOT} \ket{01}\]

            This is how the CNOT operation is denoted in the Quantum Gate Model:

            </div>

            <h2>How do I write this gate as a matrix?</h2>
            <p>
            We can work out the matrix representation of the CNOT gate for 2 qubits by knowing what the output should be. 
            First, recall how the computational basis states are written as vectors:

            \[\ket{0} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}\] 
            \[\ket{1} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}\]

            So if we have 2 qubits we need to consider all 4 possible states and collect their amplitudes in a vector. 
            This is formally thought of as taking the kronecker product of the 2 qubits, however the kronecker operator
            is often dropped. The full 2 qubit state is then written like so:

            \[\ket{0} \otimes \ket{0} = \ket{00} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}\]
            \[\ket{0} \otimes \ket{1} = \ket{01} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}\]
            \[\ket{1} \otimes \ket{0} = \ket{10} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}\]
            \[\ket{1} \otimes \ket{1} = \ket{11} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}\]

            I'm showing the quantum state using the top qubit in the circuit as the rightmost qubit in the ket. Let's work 
            through each of the states and construct the CNOT matrix as we go. It's worth mentioning that this takes the form 
            of a permutation matrix.
            
            \[\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & & & \\ 0 & & & \\ 0 & & & \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}\]
            \[\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & & \\ 0 & 0 & & \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}\]
            \[\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0\\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}\]
            \[\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0\\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}\]
            

            You may see the CNOT 2 qubit matrix take on a different form in other sources. This is due to the order in which
            you consider the target and control qubits, essentially a question of endianess. Here we've adopted the 
            standard that the top qubit in the circuit diagram is the rightmost qubit in the ket.
            </p>

            <h2>What if I have more than 2 qubits?</h2>
            <p>
            What happens now if we have more than 2 qubits and want to write out the effect of a CNOT gate across two of the qubits?
            For example, let's consider the 3 qubit case. There are multiple ways of arranging a CNOT gate, let's just consider the following
            as an example:

            <div class="flex-center">
                <figure>
                    <img  src="/Sources/CNOT/3qubits_cnot.png" width="250" height="250">
                </figure>
            </div>
            </p>
            <p>
            Now \(\ket{a}\) is our control qubit, \(\ket{b}\) is unaffected, and \(\ket{c}\) is our target qubit. So we know our input state
            should transform as follows:

            \[\ket{000} \xrightarrow{CNOT} \ket{000}\]
            \[\ket{001} \xrightarrow{CNOT} \ket{101}\]
            \[\ket{010} \xrightarrow{CNOT} \ket{010}\]
            \[\ket{011} \xrightarrow{CNOT} \ket{111}\]
            \[\ket{100} \xrightarrow{CNOT} \ket{100}\]
            \[\ket{101} \xrightarrow{CNOT} \ket{001}\]
            \[\ket{110} \xrightarrow{CNOT} \ket{110}\]
            \[\ket{111} \xrightarrow{CNOT} \ket{011}\]

            We could now follow the same procedure as last time to show how the full matrix representation could be written down. However,
            this quickly becomes tedious. We may also likely need to create a matrix representation of a CNOT gate across a much larger 
            quantum circuit so we'll need a better method. 
            </p>

            <h2>What is the general solution?</h2>
            <p>
            If we have many more qubits and need to write down a matrix representation of our CNOT gate the earlier method will quickly
            become intractable. In fact, we can write down a very succint representation of the CNOT gate for any amount of qubits. Here it is:

            \[
            \text{CNOT}_{\text{TC}} = \overbrace{\text{i}_\text{d}}^{\text{Target}} \otimes \text{i}_\text{d} ... \otimes \overbrace{\ket{0}\bra{0}}^{\text{Control}}
                                    + \overbrace{\sigma_{x}}^{\text{Target}} \otimes \text{i}_\text{d} ... \otimes \overbrace{\ket{1}\bra{1}}^{\text{Control}}
            \]

            Just to clarify, \(\otimes\) in this context is the kronecker product, \(\text{i}_\text{d}\) is the 2x2 identity matrix, and 
            \(\sigma_{x}\) is the Pauli-X or NOT gate. We also see two other matrices, the zero projector \(\ket{0}\bra{0}\) and the one 
            projector \(\ket{1}\bra{1}\). We must move the location of the four matrices noted in the above expression to align with our
            quantum circuit. Consider the 2 qubit case first:

            <div class="flex-center">
                <figure>
                    <img  src="/Sources/CNOT/equiv_2qubit.png" width="500" height="500">
                </figure>
            </div>
            </p>

            <p>
            So in this case we would write the CNOT expression as:

            \[\text{CNOT}_{21} = \overbrace{\text{i}_{\text{d}}}^{\text{Target}} \otimes \overbrace{\ket{0}\bra{0}}^{\text{Control}} + \overbrace{\sigma_{x}}^{\text{Target}} \otimes \overbrace{\ket{1}\bra{1}}^{\text{Control}}\]

            The zero projector will resolve to 1 if the control is \(\ket{0}\) and the one projector will resolve to 0. If the control is \(\ket{1}\) then the one projector will
            resolve to 1 and the zero projector will resolve to 0. So in affect, we are choosing one of the two terms depending on the value of the control qubit.
            
            <!-- Explicitly multiply this out with input states -->

            Let's see another example, this time with 3 qubits:

            <div class="flex-center">
                <figure>
                    <img  src="/Sources/CNOT/equiv_3qubits.png" width="500" height="500">
                </figure>
            </div>
            </p>

            <h2>Can I make a program to generate this matrix for me?</h2>
            <p>
            Absolutely, here is an implementation in Python that will return the full CNOT matrix given the number of qubits, the target qubit index, 
            and the control qubit index. This could probably be made more efficient but it works for now! Of course, if you try to generate the CNOT matrix
            for a large number of qubits you will quickly run out of memory.
